# SQLWrapper
Writing a wrapper for SQLite3 in python


# Purpose
The purpose of writing a wrapper class for SQLite3 was to help my understanding of how SQL works.


# Function
You can use the code to make a server with a database file that holds sql tables that can be modified by any of the clients.

As of upload it contains basic querying as well as adding columns to a table and creating a table.
However, I got to the point of adding the joint fuctionality and decided I would rather make my own language for managing databases.

You can find my current progress on my language Tisch here: https://github.com/inbelic/Tisch
